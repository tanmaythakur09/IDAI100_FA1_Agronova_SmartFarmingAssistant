# IDAI100 – FA1 Generative AI Project  
# 🌾 Agronova: Smart Farming Assistant

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Agronova is an AI-powered Smart Farming Assistant designed to provide intelligent, structured agricultural guidance using Generative AI.  

The system integrates Google Gemini API to generate advisory responses related to crop selection, pest management, soil improvement, weather-based farming decisions, and sustainable agricultural practices.

This project was developed as part of:

Course: IDAI100 – Generative AI  
Assessment: FA-1 Planning & Designing

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Farmers often lack timely, personalized, and reliable agricultural guidance. Decisions related to crop selection, soil treatment, pest control, and climate adaptation directly impact productivity and sustainability.

Agronova addresses this problem by using structured prompt engineering and AI-generated recommendations to assist farmers in informed decision-making.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1️⃣ Crop Recommendation System
Suggests suitable crops based on:
- Soil type
- Region
- Season
- Irrigation availability

---

### 2️⃣ Pest & Disease Advisory
Provides AI-generated guidance to:
- Identify possible crop diseases
- Suggest preventive and corrective measures

---

### 3️⃣ Weather-Based Farming Advice
Offers precautionary recommendations based on:
- Rainfall forecasts
- High temperature alerts
- Climate risks

---

### 4️⃣ Soil & Fertilizer Guidance
Advises on:
- Soil pH improvement
- Nutrient management
- Fertilizer recommendations

---

### 5️⃣ Sustainable Farming Practices
Encourages:
- Water-efficient techniques
- Organic alternatives
- Environmentally responsible agriculture

---

## 🧠 AI & API Integration

Agronova integrates the Google Gemini API to process structured agricultural prompts and generate advisory outputs.

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

Prompts are structured to include:
- Specific crop or issue
- Geographic or environmental context
- Clear farming condition
- Desired outcome

This structured approach improves response accuracy and reduces ambiguity.

---

### Model Parameters Tested

- Temperature: 0.2 → More factual, reliable outputs  
- Temperature: 0.8 → More detailed and creative responses  
- Max Tokens: 200–600 depending on response complexity  

Lower temperature values were preferred for agricultural accuracy.

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

Agronova provides advisory recommendations and does not replace certified agricultural experts. Users are encouraged to verify critical decisions through local agricultural authorities.

AI outputs depend on prompt clarity and may not reflect real-time environmental changes.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Real-time weather API integration  
- Regional language support  
- Mobile deployment  
- Image-based crop disease detection
